# Use the monitoring data to provide live indicators for 
# what you need to do with the data
# For example, if it detects model drift, send a notification to fix it or use a command
# If possible to send the data over
# Things need to happen to the machine learning nodel according to what it needs
# If it needs more data find out how to continuously upload data into the model
# If it needs to have more epochs, figure out how many epochs you need
# Remember that these ML models are for making predictions in addition to 
# viewing the current status of communities across the globe
